# StudentBlazorWebApp
The Student Project Blazor WebApp & Server is a comprehensive educational platform that utilizes the Blazor framework to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces for student management systems. Blazor allows developers to build client-side web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript, which can run on the server (Blazor Server) in the browser (Blazor WebAssembly).
